# www.oceanpkg.org

The Ocean package manager is still very much in the works and won't be released
for quite some time. While that happens, we're also working on Ocean's corner of
the Internet.

## Missing links

You may have noticed that the site redirects to two subdomains that don't exist
yet:
- drops.oceanpkg.org
- docs.oceanpkg.org

These are also in the works and will be out soon™.

## Localization

The site is available in the following languages:

- [English](https://www.oceanpkg.org/en-US/)
- [Español](https://www.oceanpkg.org/es-ES/)

If you find any translation errors or awkward wording, please file an issue or
submit a pull request!

## Donations

The Ocean project is run by volunteers in their spare time. Any financial
contributions are _greatly_ appreciated. ❤️
