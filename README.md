Ocean is the package manager from the future, coming to an OS near you!

It is still very much in the works and won't be released for quite some time.
While that happens, we're also working on Ocean's corner of the Internet.

## Donations

The Ocean project is run by volunteers in their spare time. Any financial
contributions are _greatly_ appreciated. ❤️
